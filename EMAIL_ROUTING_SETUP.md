# Email Routing Setup for Contact Form

## Current Issue
The contact form is receiving a **500 Internal Server Error** with reference `mk2apjgkas65r84eh9d952kq` because Email Routing is not properly configured.

## Required Setup Steps

### 1. Enable Email Routing in Cloudflare Dashboard

1. **Log in** to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
2. **Select your domain** (loomsandbunkars.com or whatever domain you're using)
3. Go to **Email** → **Email Routing**
4. Click **Get started** or **Enable Email Routing**

### 2. Add and Verify Destination Address

1. In Email Routing, go to **Routes** section
2. Under **Destination addresses**, click **Add destination address**
3. Enter: `shubxam@gmail.com`
4. Click **Send verification email**
5. **Check your Gmail inbox** and click the verification link
6. Wait for the status to show **Verified**

### 3. Configure DNS Records

Email Routing will automatically add these DNS records:
- **MX records** pointing to Cloudflare's email servers
- **SPF record** including Cloudflare's email routing

Make sure these are added and active.

### 4. Create Email Route (Optional)

While we're using the send_email binding, you can also create a custom route:
1. In **Routes**, click **Create address**
2. Enter something like: `contact@yourdomain.com`
3. Set action to **Send to an email**
4. Select `shubxam@gmail.com` as destination

## Testing the Current Setup

I've temporarily modified the Worker to:
1. **Log all form submissions** to the console (visible in Cloudflare dashboard)
2. **Return success** even if email fails, so you can test the form works
3. **Show specific error messages** about email configuration

## How to Check Email Routing Status

1. In Cloudflare Dashboard → Email → Email Routing
2. Look for:
   - ✅ **Email DNS records configured**
   - ✅ **shubxam@gmail.com** shows as **Verified**
   - ✅ **Email Routing** status is **Active**

## Once Email Routing is Setup

After completing the setup:
1. Deploy the Worker again: `npm run deploy`
2. Test the contact form
3. You should receive emails at `shubxam@gmail.com`
4. Check Cloudflare logs for any remaining issues

## Troubleshooting

If you still get errors after setup:
- Check the **Email Routing** dashboard for any warnings
- Verify your domain's **MX records** are pointing to Cloudflare
- Make sure **SPF record** includes Cloudflare's email routing
- Check if your domain is using **Cloudflare as authoritative nameserver**

The form validation and frontend are working correctly - it's just the email backend that needs configuration.
