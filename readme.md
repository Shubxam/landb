This repository holds the code for the website of a banaras (varanasi) focused organisation, 'Looms&Bunkars'. 

Looms&Bunkars works with the weavers (bunkars) of banaras to match them with right buyers and help them get the best value/compensation for their product (banarasi handloom saree). Looms&Bunkars is an embodiment of culture of banaras and its ghats and its people and weavers.

Looms&Bunkars is also on a mission to educate visitors about the heritage of banarasi handloom sarees. What it takes to create one. How each saree is product of countless hours put in by the weavers, undeterred focus and generational knowledge passed over to them by their ancestors. Essentially how this is an art which has stood the test of time and has evolved through generations to reach where it is. How prominent it has been as a part of indian culture and traditions.

The Organisation is headed by Diksha Rai, who has her roots in banaras, and is also doing a doctoral thesis (PhD) on the how these weavers are exploited and not given due credit and compensation for the hard-work they put in, and hardships they face to deepen her understanding of the craft and the people associated with it.
